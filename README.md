Indian Institute of Information Technology, Sri City (IIITS)

Instructor: Dr. Prerana Mukherjee

TAs:
MS(R): Abhijit Mohanta,
Vennelakanti Vyshnavi

UG: Rohan Sukumaran,
Arvind Deshraj

Class Time (Location): MWF: 9.00 AM - 11.00 AM (113& 115)
Tutorial Time (Location): Monday: 2.30 PM - 4.30 PM (113& 115)

Deliverables for Project:
1. Codebase+ReadMe: to be hosted as Github repository. 
2. Report in IEEE/ ACM double-column format (in .docx/.pdf).
3. Demo (2-min video showing the workflow of the system)+ Live Working Demo during evaluation
4. App links, Website links

Regulations in Project Work:
1. Form a team size of 6 inter-section groups are allowed.
2. Clearly demarcate the work so that during evaluation marks can be alloted as per the work distribution. 
3. Report and code should be free of any plagiarised content from any web sources. In case you take a particular code snippet or text from any web sources for report writing so give proper credits in the reference section as well as cross-reference it in the report draft.
4. Report should have following subsections: i) Abstract: outlining your problem statement, workflow and key results in brief, ii) Problem Statement: clearly out line the problem statement, motivation, key challenges, key highlights/contributions in the work, how do you handle the various challenges?
iii) Methodology: Put ER diagram, UML Class Diagram, USE CASE Diagram, System Design (Architecture Diagram showing work flow), Set of tools used: Front End and Back End, Explanation of the modules in the system
iv) Results: Snapshots of the UI, Key tables (if any), Results and Analysis, Discussion, Robustness Testing (some performance numbers if you state of your system vis-Ã -vis already existing systems), Strengths & Drawbacks (if any)
v) Conclusion & Future Direction
5. You can record the screen to show the workflow in your system for video.

Note: Additional scoring points would be there on novelty and innovative packaging of the system. Refrain from using projects done in ASE and same project topics. You can use any software for developing your system's front end (refer to syllabus to see few s/w). Database element is must [Any: MYSQL/ORACLE/MongoDB/DynamoDB/Cassandra].
